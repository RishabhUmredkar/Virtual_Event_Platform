# Virtual Event Platform

Welcome to the Virtual Event Platform â€“ your go-to solution for seamless event ticket booking, whether it's for physical venues or online experiences. This project is designed with two distinct modules: one catering to users and the other empowering administrators to manage events efficiently.

## User Module

### Registration
Before diving into the world of events, users must register. Registration is mandatory and facilitated by Java code utilizing cookies for a smooth and secure process.

### Event Exploration
Once registered, users can explore a diverse range of events conveniently categorized into venue-based and online experiences. Events are organized chronologically, allowing users to browse and choose based on their preferences.

### Event Details and Booking
Upon selecting an event, users access detailed information such as location, description, timing, duration, host, ticket prices, and the remaining ticket availability. Users can easily book multiple tickets for an event of their choice.

### Checkout and Payment
After confirming the event, users proceed to the checkout page, where they review a summary of their order, including the total amount and cost per ticket. Securely pay the bill by entering card details and user information.

### Booking Confirmation and Invoice
Upon successful payment, users are redirected to a booking confirmation page. An invoice is generated, featuring a QR code containing the entire order summary. Users can download the invoice in PDF format for future reference.

### Profile Management
The platform offers a user-friendly profile section where logged-in users can monitor their booking status, explore personal details, and access additional features.

## Admin Module

### Dashboard
Administrators have a dedicated dashboard for efficient management of events and user data.

### Event Creation
Admins can effortlessly create both online and venue-based events, providing flexibility and diversity in the platform's offerings.

### User Management
